# E-Mail_Marketing_Performance_Analysis
Modern marketing teams rely heavily on email campaigns to reach customers —
but which subject lines, keywords, and variants actually drive results?

This project simulates a real-world digital marketing scenario where we analyze email campaign data to:

-Compare the performance of Variant A vs Variant B using A/B testing

-Discover which keywords boost open and click rates using NLP

-Provide actionable business insights for optimizing marketing campaigns
